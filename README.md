#WrastleWark challenge

I solve this challenge using the following technologies:

- Kotlin.
- MVVM pattern.
- Coroutines.
- Data binding.
- LiveData.
- Jetpack Navigation Controller.
- Safe Args.

I did use the following libraries:

- Retrofit, to be able to retrieve json data.
- Moshi, to be able to parse retrieved data.
- Koin, to be able to inject dependencies.
- Glide, to load images efficiently.

I used **jUnit5** and **Mockito** test *data* and *domain* layers.

In order to be able to determine the gender of gnomes, I developed a method to count characters within their names, when this number is **even** it is a **female** and, when is **odd** it is a **male**.

Also you can find gnomes by their names.
